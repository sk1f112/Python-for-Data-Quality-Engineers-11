# News Feed Project

A command-line application that simulates a news feed where users can publish different types of posts (News, Private Ads, Unique User Posts) either manually or by loading structured files (`.txt`, `.json`, `.xml`). It also stores the data in a SQLite database using an ODBC driver.

- Support for `.txt`, `.json`, and `.xml` input formats
- Three post types:
  - News
  - Private Advertisement
  - Unique Custom Post
- Data normalization (punctuation, capitalization)
